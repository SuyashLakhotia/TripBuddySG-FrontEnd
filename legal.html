                        <p>LAST UPDATED: 21st December 2015</p>
                        <p></p>

                        <p>Welcome to the website (the "Site") of TripBuddy.SG ("TripBuddy.SG", "we", "us" and/or "our"). This Site has been created to provide a marketplace for local experiences (the "Services") for our users ("you", "your").</p>
                        <p>We take your privacy very seriously. We ask that you read this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") carefully as it contains important information about what to expect when we collect personal information about you ("Personal Data") and how we will use your Personal Data.</p>
                        <p>This Policy applies to information we collect on www.tripbuddy.sg and its sub-domains about:

We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on this Site without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal Data to us through this Site, please contact us, and we will endeavour to delete that information from our databases.</p>

                        <p>By providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of TripBuddy.SG and authorised third parties.</p>

                        <h1>Fee & Booking Policy</h1>

                        <p>LAST UPDATED: 21st December 2015</p>
                        <p></p>

                        <p>Your plans while you're on exchange in Singapore are always subject to change. Taking this into consideration, all local hosts on our platform commit to help you with a flexible booking policy. Below are our marketplace policies relating to fees, cancellations and refunds. It is at our sole discretion to amend these policies from time to time and it is your responsibility to regularly check the Site to determine if there have been changes.</p>


                        <h2>1. FEES</h2>

                        <p>There are two types of fees involved in our marketplace transactions. You may refer below for the detailed description of each fee. If you have any questions on our fee policy, please contact us at contact@tripbuddy.sg.</p>

                        <p>a. Processing Fee
                            <br> For every booking between buyers and sellers, TripBuddy.sg collects a processing fee of 10% of the total value. This processing fee shall be deducted directly from the amount paid to us, and is non-refundable in all circumstances, unless your trip/activity/event is cancelled by the seller. The processing fee is used for our marketplace maintenance and geographical expansion to serve you better.</p>

                        <p>b. Transaction Fee
                            <br> Our payment system accepts PayPal and credit/debit cards supported by PayPal. All payments transacted through PayPal are subject to a PayPal fee. The PayPal fee is comprised of a fixed component and a variable component. This fee is borne by sellers and according to PayPal, the variable component will be refunded on a pro-rata basis in case of approved cancellation. The PayPal fee and its refund policy may change from time to time at the discretion of PayPal. If you would like to know more about PayPal fees, please refer to the <a href="https://www.paypal.com">PayPal website</a>.</p>


                        <h2>2. CANCELLATION POLICY</h2>

                        <p>You are allowed to request for cancellation of your booking(s) at least 24 hours prior to 12:00 AM local time of the activity date. All cancellation requests shall be reviewed by our team and the purchaser will be informed of the outcome by email. An approved cancellation request shall incur a processing fee of 10% of the total booking value. Late cancellation requests are considered a "no-show" and will incur full booking charges.</p>


                        <h2>3. REFUND POLICY</h2>

                        <p>Refunds arising from any cancellation shall be informed by messaging the seller & purchasers directly on their provided email addresses. Fund transfer will be processed within ten (10) working days from the email date.</p>

                        <p>If you have any questions about our policies, you can email us at contact@tripbuddy.sg.</p>
